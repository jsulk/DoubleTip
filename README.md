# DoubleTip

DoubleTip is an iOS application created by Jake Sulkoske to be distributed on the App Store. 

The goal of the project is to demonstrate how I would integrate new iOS technologies and architectures into a basic iOS application.

These patterns and decisions are made with scalability and robustness in mind, and should be viewed as a roadmap to building a healthy large-scale mobile application.

## Showcase
In this project, I aim to demonstrate a cohesion with the following elements:
- SwiftUI
- CoreData for offline perssistent data storage
- Async/Await
- Unit & UITesting Suites
- MVVM Architecture

## Installation

Use git to clone the app. Launch locally on the main branch. No additional packages or libraries 

Requirements: 
- Xcode 16.1
- iOS 17.5

## Future plans

This app is meant to be a playground for new functionality. 
In the future, I hope to explore the following:
- Update CoreData implementation to SwiftData
- Update current test suites to Swift Testing
- Integrate the use of actors and swift Macros
